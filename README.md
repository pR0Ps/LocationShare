Location Share
==============

Location Share is a simple Android application that allows you to share your current location.

Location Share doesn't require setting up an account, doesn't track your location in the background,
doesn't auto-share it, and doesn't send it to anyone except those you explicitly tell it to.

It can share your location using any application that supports sharing plain text. This includes
(but isn't limited to) sharing via SMS, email, social networks, note taking applications, etc.

Simply launch the application and wait until the device homes in on your location. You'll then have
the option to view the location on a map, share it, or copy it to the clipboard.
