Location Share
==============

A simple Android application that shares your current location.

Location Share doesn't collect any data from you, doesn't require internet access, doesn't require
setting up an account, doesn't track your location in the background, doesn't auto-share it, and
doesn't send it to anyone except those you explicitly tell it to.

It can share your location using any application that supports sharing plain text. This includes
(but isn't limited to) sharing via SMS, email, social networks, note taking applications, etc.

Simply launch the application and wait until the device homes in on your location. You'll then have
the option to view the location on a map, share it, or copy it to the clipboard.
