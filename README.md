LocationShare
=============

A simple Android application to share your location.

Unlike other applications, LocationShare doesn't require setting up an account, doesn't track your location in the background, doesn't autoshare it, and doesn't send it to anyone except those you explicitly tell it to.


Usage
=====

Launch the application, wait until the device homes in on your location, then hit the share button.

LocationShare allows you to share your location via any application that supports sharing plaintext. This includes (but isn't limited to) sharing via SMS, email, social networks, note taking appliactions, etc.
